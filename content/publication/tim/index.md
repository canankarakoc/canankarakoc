abstract: 

Infectious diseases remain a major cause of global mortality, yet basic questions concerning the relationship between within-host processes governing pathogen burden (pathogen replication, immune responses) and population-scale (epidemiological) patterns of mortality remain obscure. We use a structured literature review to leverage the extensive biomedical data generated by controlled host infections to address the epidemiological question of whether infection-induced mortality is constant, accelerating, or follows some other pattern of change and to infer the within-host mechanistic basis of this pattern. We show that across diverse lethal infection models, the risk of death increases approximately exponentially in time since infection, in a manner phenomenologically similar to the dynamics of all-cause death. We further show that this pattern of accelerating risk is consistent with multiple alternate mechanisms of pathogen growth and host-pathogen interaction, underlining the limitations of current experimental approaches to connect within-host processes to epidemiological patterns. We review critical experimental questions that our work highlights, requiring additional non-invasive data on pathogen burden throughout the course of infection.
