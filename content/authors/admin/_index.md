I am a research scholar in [Brown Lab](https://microbes.sitehost.iu.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am lucky that I had the chance to work with [Jay Lennon](https://lennonlab.github.io/) for the past couple of years at Indiana University Bloomington. 

I am broadly interested in eco-evolutionary dynamics of communities and how they persist and maintain coexistence in space and time. I have a soft spot for microbes -anything smaller than 1mm. They are amazing minute-like organisms and allow us to see evolution in action within days. I like to combine these tiny bits of amazing biology with eco-evolutionary theories to understand -and hopefully predict, how time and changes shape genes, populations, communities, and ecosystems. 

I like drawing, illustrating, and doodling. Here are some nature-inspired ones; you can also check my social media for more. Philosophy of science, macro photography, crafting, and playing music are some other stuff I like.
