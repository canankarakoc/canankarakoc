I am a postdoctoral scholar in [Lennon Lab](https://microbes.sitehost.iu.edu/) at Indiana University Bloomington. 

I am broadly interested in eco-evolutionary dynamics of communities, and how they persist and maintain coexistence in space and time. I have a soft spot for microbes -anything smaller than 1mm. I think they are amazing minute-like-organisms and allow us see evolution in action within days. 

I really like to combine these tiny bits of amazing biology to eco-evolutionary theories to understand -and hopefully predict, how the time and changes shape genes, populations, communities and ecosystems. 

Lately I found myself nature, life and death inspired pen&ink drawing and doodling science for kids. I like to read philosophy and ask questions. I also play guitar and sing, poorly.
