If you are reading this blog for the first time, do not forget to read the beginning: "Awareness".

I was going to write about change and how to navigate through changes sometime later, but  this was the topic on Sunday morning meditation, so I wanted to go ahead and write about it now. 

There is something that we ultimately know but tend to forget in our daily lives, and that is "change". In the words of modern Buddhism: "Everything is permanently impermanent". Things are always consistently and constantly changing.

We cannot stop the change. Situations are changing, people and things around us are changing, our bodies are changing. Even our mind is changing, which is seventeen times faster than the body. 

We are labeling things that do not exist. We are attached places, people, situations and things. We hold on to impermanent things, and we suffer when they are gone. If we lean on an impermanent thing, we fall with it when it falls. We then build worries, anxiety and tension. If we accept the change, we would go along with it instead of attaching to the imaginary truth. 

Although we know that the change is ultimate truth, none teaches us to practice this and realize that ourselves and our minds are not permanent too. Instead of trying to stop changes, control or reverse, we can focus on our own change in a positive way.

When I started my physical, mental and spiritual healing journey, I was pretty much hopeless and low. I thought that I will never change. Rewiring the mind, reversing the physiological effects and communicating with soul sounded me like a science fiction, not regular neurology, psychology or biology. I have been witnessing my own change every single day when I face with my patterns, their reasons, and practicing a lot to replace them. I know that not everyone has the deep motivation and time to change fast, but you just stick to it, be confident and consistent.

I almost cried when my therapist said that "look, you needed a parent figure to navigate through your insecurities, now you can be a parent". I never wanted to be a parent, maybe because of my negative patterns that I got from my parents and grandparents, and carried for so long. 

Our Buddhist nun said to me and my journey friend that she is so happy to see that we get things, analyse and apply in our life. I thought I stuck in this life, body and mind, and I can never ever change them. I am trying not to be attached to the past or present moment, I am trying to be okay with changes, and do my best to go with the flow. 

Things do not exist, unless we name them. Hate, anger, frustration and irritation towards things or people are our narratives. A stranger can be a friend, if you really want to. Foes can be also your friends if you change your perspective. It is of course not about sticking to an abusive partnership/friendship, but filling your heart with love and kindness. First step is to be kind to yourself. If you love yourself, you can love the world. 

Some changes will come like a tornado. You should be mentally and physically ready, and filled with kindness and love in your inner world. Train your mind, so when bad things happen, you can see them as opportunity to test your strength and contribute to your inner growth.
