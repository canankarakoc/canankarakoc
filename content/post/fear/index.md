Fear has stopped me doing a lot of things that I wanted to do. I really believed that fear is my intuition, until I learned that it is a stop signal of sympathetic nervous system trying to protect me. It keeps me in my comfort zone, especially when I will do something that I have not done before. 

It is not always about big things like career change, planning a parenthood or divorce. Your brain might stop you doing simple things like a new sport, socializing, giving a presentation or going to new places. Fear feels real, it is biology, evolution, a physical experience with all senses that makes it difficult to identify. 

"Fear of the unknown".

If you are aware of it now, next time you can identify when you are afraid of something. My strategy was not to ignore it and try to understand where does it come from. My therapist was asking me "What would happen if you do X?". Half of my thoughts were irrational: Things might happen, but has one in a million chance. The other half were caused by past traumas. It helped me to think about the real reasons and let them slowly go. 

I am paraphrasing a technique that I have learned from somewhere: When you feel it, realize it and say "thank you for warning me my body, but stop controlling me and let me do my stuff". If you step back, you can see other possibilities, also find creative solutions.

"Fight or flight".

Another technique I have learned is "take a deep breath": Four seconds inhale, eight seconds exhale. Breathing activates the parasympathetic system, which helps you deactivate fight or flight response.

Also, friends, you do not live the moment, if you are afraid of something might happen in future even thought the probability is high. What you do is to sabotage the joy and productivity at that moment. What you simply do is to do everything for that fearful scenario.
Of course, you should have some fear to keep you on track, but balance it. What I am saying is that do not afraid of stupid things. 

"Just do it, and also stick to it" said my therapist.

After I face my fears and resolve where they come from,  I just go and do. I have done so many things that I have postponed for so long or has not felt secure enough to start. I made new friends, got new hobbies, put myself out, set new goals, and I still have tons of energy to do more. If you work on your confidence, fearful thoughts come less and less everyday, or they become easy to deal with. I think I will write about insecurities in the next post. 

"Invisible boundary" is Thoreau's terminology for fear. 

I am going to paraphrase my therapist again: "Do you have the intellectual capacity to manage detoxing tomorrow? Enjoy that bucket of ice-cream today!".
