In past years, I participated in [Science Fest](https://scienceoutreach.indiana.edu/news-events/science-fest/index.html) at IU. It is a public event encouraging the Bloomington community to come on campus and learn about research. Lennon Lab hosted a "Bacterial Viruses" table where we explained a bacteriophage infection using illustrations, 3D models, and lab samples.
