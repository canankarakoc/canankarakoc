title: Eco-evolutionary dynamics and trait evolution
---

Abiotic and biotic interactions may constrain the evolution of traits. More specifically, we observe host bacterial species co-evolving with their predator bacteriophage, competitors, and different selection pressures over generations. We especially simulate noisy antibiotic exposure or resource levels to understand the effect of environmental stochasticity on the population dynamics and the trait shifts. We measure the shifts in life history and functional traits of the isolated focal species, we have them compete with their ancestors and estimate their relative fitness.
